# Linear Model Selection and Regularization

Motivation: In the following chapters, we would move from a linear world to non-linear one. Before extending the linear models to non-linear models, we discuss in this chapter some ways in which the simple linear model can be improved, by replacing plain least squares fitting with some alternative fitting procedures. These alternatives are just slight modifications of the traditional linear models, such as model selection and dimension reduction. Moreover, these approaches can be applied to other models, such as classification and logistic regressions. In one words, we try to select the “best predictors” among all candidates.

Main goal: To be aware of the model selection criteria such as the statistics Cp, AIC, BIC and adjusted R2, etc. To know the 3 classes of model selection methods: subset selection, shrinkage, dimension reduction.
